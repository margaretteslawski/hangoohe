WoT Starter Pack only usable when you create an account ; you can't use the Starter Pack code on accounts that already exist. I've been roleplaying in Skyrim since I started my channel (https://www.youtube.com/TheJessaChannel) 6 years ago. I never considered ESO because I hate the idea of MMOs (play with others! Never! Muh immersion!) but I was looking for something to do with my patrons for the upcoming 100 patrons celebration and I decided to give ESO a try. I did try ESO during the beta and hated it and never went back, until now. To my great surprise, I don't just like ESO, I love it. MUCH more than Skyrim. # Warning! If you update one of the mods that uses McJtyLib you have to update all of them! McJtyLib 3.5.0 is not backwards compatible! # Changelog AquaMunda 0.6.0 Depends on McJtyLib 3.5.0! Fixed recipe for the grindstone manual Fixed a crash when breaking a tank in creative mode Fixed a few grindstone recipes (wheat->flour and sugarcane->sugar) Added JEI recipe integration for the cooker, grindstone and cutting board Ariente 0.0.9-alpha Depends on McJtyLib 3.5.0!. #The Division 2 Open Beta First, a huge thank you to all the Agents that joined us for the Private Beta and the Technical Test to help us test the game, give feedback, report issues and share your experience with us. Your feedback is vital to the development of the game, and we have taken what you have said to heart. For the Open Beta, we have made many improvements to The Division 2 based on the testing and feedback from the Private Beta. Overall, we have worked hard on the technical 
Here is the team-oriented, competitive game mode that will keep even solo players and casuals paying to play. It will increase average twitch viewers for the category and employ a lot of new content creators. Consult with me please if there are any questions for design and balance. It's quite simple and can be completed in a week or two, tops. The beta could be running by July/August for peak revenue and testing, followed by an extended 3 month beta which could lead into a full release in Decem. ###Goodman made several comments in the forums today. Geoff appreciation thread >Thanks! >Overwatch is certainly a challenging game to both tune and continually add new/interesting content. When I think back to how the game was in beta, or even launch, I feel like we’ve come a long way since then. Remember, there was a time when McCree’s fan the hammer did full damage per bullet, Zenyatta had 150 health, Pharah’s Conc Blast did 700 damage to shields/barriers (poor Zen…), Reinhardt’. Hey there, I just thought I would make a post essentially updating the voted tier list from the end of last season with the new competition, and some of my opinions on the newcomers. Now that we’ve seen some spinup videos, and promotional images, we have a better understanding of what the field of robots looks like this year for 2019. I made a similar post 20 days ago, and I’ve also taken Reddit’s comments to heart to change some errors I may have made previously. Without further Previous Threads: Season 43 (https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveFromNewYork/comments/8iq85k/who_wrote_what_sketch_season_43_edition/) This is a constantly updated list of known writing credits for the sketches and Weekend Update features from Season 44. Most of the credits included in this thread come from the social media accounts of the SNL cast and writing staff. Note: Recurring sketches and Weekend Update features are often written by the same people who wrote. With Operation Israeli S.U.F.F.E.R. and the much needed top tier economy changes behind us, it is now time for the next World War Mode Closed Beta Test session. The session begins at 16:00 UTC or 12 noon EDT, or less than an hour from now. If you don't know what WWM is, click this link for an explanation I wrote after the last test. (https://old.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/aw8zeh/world_war_mode_test/ehl40gm/?st=juwgw765&sh=612c331e) For those of you who already know about

Hi all, I'm a Chinese player who started playing this game on day one of the TW/HK server (4th Oct 2018). FYI:The Chinese mainland server started on 6th Jun 2018. I have beated all PvE content so far and followed the new patch news closely on both mainland and TW game forum. My current best 5 power is around 27500. (Top of the server is around 30000 in TW and 34000 in mainland). I am trying to write a random Q&A for anything I can wish I knew when I started. So i have compiled a number of the questions and answers from the Community Q Will the clan system be available upon launch for Xbox/PS4? >Clans will not be available at launch however implementation of these will be considered in the future. !!! ALERT: FORBIDDEN SCIENCE DETECTED !!! (https://i.imgur.com/qApH35m.png) Beta 8 has landed, and with 38 new special items and a new mini-faction with long-term strategic implications, it's like we're back to the good old days of Cogmind Alpha where there's plenty of new content to explore and you're not always quite sure what's out there waiting :D At this point even if you've found everything there was to see as of Beta 7 (though very few have), once again you'll be making new discove. TL;DR at the bottom Hey guys, SpoiledSouls (https://imgur.com/a/nqz7By0) here, and since about a month ago, I have had a suggestion on my mind that I was not quite sure how to write out and bring forward, but since Patch 8.0, there have been 2 new mission that fell perfectly into my suggestion which is: The Block should definitely be implemented into Save the World. Now I know some of you might just turn around right So I finally got my colleagues whom are huge gamers over to show them and let them play Anthem. I've been telling them that game play is so fun I'm battling through all the bugs and embers and etc. because I hope it all comes together. I allow them each to feel the awe of flying around on my 667 Ranger on hard in free play (you know the one I've never played but have all the MW gear for). And they all loved it, at first. I loaded up my legendary Storm and did a quick free play session The news of the coming classic release consumes me with thought and wonder. Can I tell you my Shaman story that started with game release and ended in 2007? First, my RL backstory. In late 2001 after rushing in to the ER with terrible gut pain I was diagnosed with cystic kidney disease. After x-rays and initial treatment, I was consulted by a specialist who gave me the lowdown and told me she could estimate I would have about 4-6 years of function before my kidneys failed and then would requir. 
Hi everyone, This BlizzCon 2018 we had a chance to sit down with Overwatch Game Director and Vice President, Jeff Kaplan, as well as Associate Game Producer Nicole Gillett. We asked a selection of your questions from the subreddit as well as Discord (https://overwatch.gg). Thanks to Blizzard for letting us sit down for an interview, as well as providing a media pass to attend. Travel, lodging, and all other expenses are paid for out of pocket by the subreddit mods in attendance. Well, it's certainly a busy time for War Thunder. In the middle of the 1.87 reveal hype, Gaijin is running the next World War Mode Closed Beta Test session. As with last session 5 months ago, there really haven't been any major changes to the way WWM works. The changes are mainly bug fixes, QoL improvements, and slight balance changes. The change notes are as follows: Leader board has been added to the main screen of the World War Mode. The "Create vehicle preset" button has been added. Rant incoming, quite long, TLDR at bottom Hey Gaijin Entertainment, I'm done. I've been playing the open beta since 2014, I've spent a good 3000+ hours on this game, unlocked every single German plane, gone up to 8.0 in GFRB, invested my life into your game, and dropped 200 dollars minimum, yet I'm done. In a few days, when the anniversary sales come around, I won't be renewing my premium. You know why? You've fucked your game over. Every new patch, you've added new content.
